# Exploratory Data Analysis on Movie Dataset

## Project Overview
This project is completed as part of Task 02 of the Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.  
The goal of this task is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights.

A movie dataset is used in this project to analyze movie ratings, popularity, runtime, and audience engagement using visualizations.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values and remove irrelevant columns
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Identify trends and patterns in movie data

## Dataset
- Dataset Type: Movie Dataset
- Source: Kaggle / TMDB Dataset
- Features Used:
  - title
  - vote_average
  - vote_count
  - popularity
  - runtime
  - original_language

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
- Distribution of movie ratings
- Distribution of movie runtimes
- Popularity vs rating analysis
- Top movies based on vote count
- Language-wise rating analysis

## Key Insights
- Most movies have ratings between 6 and 8
- Movies with higher vote counts tend to be more popular
- Average movie runtime ranges between 90 and 120 minutes
- English-language movies dominate the dataset
- High popularity does not always mean high ratings
